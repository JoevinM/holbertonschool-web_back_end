## Project Overview

This project introduces **ES6 Classes**, a modern way to structure and organize JavaScript code using object-oriented programming principles.

You will learn to:

- Define and use ES6 classes
- Implement constructors, methods, and static methods
- Use getters and setters
- Apply inheritance and polymorphism
- Work with abstract-like classes
- Override methods in child classes
- Use symbols and metaprogramming basics
- Understand hoisting issues with classes

This project is part of **Foundations v2.1 – Part 3**.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain, without external help:

### General
- How to define a Class in JavaScript
- How to add methods to a class
- Why and how to use static methods
- How to extend a class from another
- How inheritance works in ES6
- How to override methods
- What Symbols are used for
- The basics of metaprogramming
- How JavaScript class hoisting works
- How implicit type conversion works using `Symbol.toPrimitive`
